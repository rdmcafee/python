Pyrate - Optical Raytracing with Python
-------------------------------------

Supports:
  - 3d arrangement of optical elements
  - sequential raytracing (non sequential planned)
  - isotropic media
  - anisotropic media
  - grin media
  - dispersion relations of different types
  - interface to refractive-index.info material data base
  - optimization with different optimizers

Works both with Python 2.7 and Python 3.5+.
